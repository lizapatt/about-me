        <h3>The Basics<br/></h3>

        <p>I am 21 years old.<br/>
            I currently live in Melbourne. I am originally from Cambodia.</br>
            I am a third year student at the University of Melbourne.</br>
            I enjoy exploring the world of data science and artificial intelligence.

        <h3>Kode With Klossy</h3>
        <p>I began my KWK journey three years ago in the '22 Mobile Development Camp.
            Since I aged out of the camps, it has been really exciting to get the opportunity to revisit
            the KWK community through the alumni program.

        <h3>Fun Facts</h3>
        <p>
            I record song covers on GarageBand.</br>
            I am on the hunt for the best latte in Melbourne.</br>
            Forest green is my favourite colour. (Is it so hard to tell?)
